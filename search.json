    "text": "Arden Louchheim is an aspiring data journalist who enjoys combining her love and passion for sports with the data analytics skills she has learned this semester. She has been an athlete her entire life, and this passion has stretched beyond just an enjoyment of being a player. Her time as an athlete has shown her the important role that data plays in performance, and how data can truly tell stories when it is examined with intention.\nThe ability to create an appealing story through her knowledge of sports and skills of data analysis has been incredibly rewarding. Through the use of coding and other software, she is able to answer sports questions that once felt abstract and inconclusive."
